# Computational framework of tsunami numerical simulation fabrication
we utilized shell script to force a change of COMCOT's input regarding various scenarios. 
input will be adjusted to geographical bed deformation source; therefore, we developed a moving boundary condition to maximize time efficiency without putting behind the model's quality. 
after a lot of trial and errors, we finalized inatews.sh which is attached in this project.
